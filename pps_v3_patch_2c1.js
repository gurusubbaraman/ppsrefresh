     The icons are already geometrically centred (measured: the Nataraja
     asset is a 50.0%/50.0% top-bottom ink split, and every icon sits in
     an identical 18px flex box). Two still READ high, for two different
     reasons:
       • pancha_bhoota  — the flame emoji's ink is drawn tapering upward,
         so its visual mass sits above the glyph-box centre.
       • pancha_sabhai  — the Nataraja is full-bleed at 18px while emoji
         render ~15px of ink with ~1.5px of slack, so it is optically
         larger/heavier and any tiny offset shows.
     Optical centring cannot be solved by CSS centring, so these get a
     deliberate offset. Positive = move DOWN. Tune values HERE only;
     `transform` is purely visual (no reflow, no layout risk).           */
